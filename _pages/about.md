I am currently an assistant researcher in BNRist, Tsinghua University in China. 
My main research area is lattice based cryptography that is a promising candidate for post-quantum cryptography offering 
great performance and functionality. 
I am particularly interested in studying lattice based cryptography from practical aspects, more specifically:
  * designing practical cryptosystems
  * developing efficient algorithmic tools
  * refining security estimates
  * side-channel attacks and countermeasures
